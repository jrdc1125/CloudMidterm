        <h1>Cloud Automation</h1>
        <p>Cloud automation is the implementation of tools and processes that reduce or eliminate the manual work that
            is
            associated with provisioning, configuring and managing cloud environments. Cloud automation tools run on top
            of
            virtual environments and can be leveraged in public and private clouds, as well as hybrid and multicloud
            environments.</p>

        <h1>Cloud Provisioning</h1>
        <p>In cloud computing, provisioning refers to the process of setting up and making IT resources available within
            a cloud environment. This includes allocating, configuring, and enabling access to resources such as
            servers, storage, networks, and services to meet the specific needs of users or organization.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Advanced Provisioning</b></li>
            <p>A formal agreement between the user and the cloud service provider that specifies the type and quantity
                of cloud resources that are required</p>
            <li><b>Dynamic Provisioning</b></li>
            <p>The cloud service provider adds or removes resources as needed based on the demand or workload of the
                applications</p>
            <li><b>User Self-Provisioning</b></li>
            <p>The user can request and access cloud resources on demand without the intervention of the cloud service
                provider</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Cost Monitoring</b></li>
            <p>Monitoring the consumption and pricing benchmarks is important. Putting control on the pricing and running the alerts about usage is also very crucial. But, this could be a real challenge in achieving the budget overrun.</p>
            <li><b>Monitoring and Managing Complex Processes</b></li>
            <p>Optimized use of cloud services, companies can depend on multiple provisioning tools. When companies deploy workloads on more than one platform it makes it becomes challenging to provide a single console to display anything.</p>
            <li><b>Resource and Service dependencies</b></li>
            <p>There are various workloads and applications in the cloud that often tap into the basic cloud infrastructure resources. Public cloud provider services carry dependencies that can lead to uncertainty and surprise costs.</p>

        <h1>Cloud Management</h1>
        <p>Cloud management is the process of maintaining control and oversight of cloud computing infrastructure, resources, and services in public, private, or hybrid cloud environments. With cloud management tools and technologies, IT administrators achieve control, visibility, and scalability while also being able to adapt rapidly to change.</p>
